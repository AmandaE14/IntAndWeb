1. PHP is a server-side programming language designed for web development. It organizes data, handles user interactions, and creates dynamic web pages on the server before sending them to the client in HTML format.
2. Both languages manage data and communicate with databases. PHP executes on the server, but JavaScript executes in the client's browser for dynamic interactions.
3. PHP is popular because of its simplicity of use, strong database connectivity, substantial community support, and built-in web developing capabilities.
4. If the require statement fails, it stops the script with a fatal error, whereas the include statement produces a warning and carries on with execution. An error is generated by an undefined variable when a variable from a file that hasn't been included is used.
5. While var_dump offers comprehensive details on a variable's data type and value and is helpful for troubleshooting intricate data structures, echo just displays strings.
