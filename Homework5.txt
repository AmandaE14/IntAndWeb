1. HTTP is a protocol used to convey data across the internet. Common HTTP request methods include GET, which requests data from a resource, POST, which submits data to be processed by a specific resource, PUT, which changes a resource, and DELETE, which deletes a specific resource.
2. An API is a collection of rules that allows various software entities to connect with one another, whereas JSON is a lightweight data format that is simple for people to read and write while also being simple for computers to understand and generate.
3. AJAX enables web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a server in the background. Asynchronous code refers to tasks that run in the background while the main program continues to operate, without waiting for it to finish.
4. REST is an architectural framework for developing networked applications that use stateless communication, often over HTTP. REST resources are things that are available through APIs, such as posts. To retrieve several posts in a RESTful application, one would use the URI /posts with a GET request. To retrieve a single post, use /posts/{id} with a GET request. To save a post, use /posts with a POST request and to update a post, use /posts/{id} with a PUT request.
5. Hoisting is the default behavior of JavaScript, which moves variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope before code execution, but not initializations. Closures are functions that have access to the environment in which they were formed, allowing them to access variables from outer functions even after they have finished running.
