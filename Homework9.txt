1. The standard language for building and administering databases is SQL, and MySQL is a particular relational database management system that makes use of SQL. Relational databases make it possible to obtain data by examining the connections between different data points.
2. In SQL, normalization arranges tables and columns to minimize duplication and preserve data integrity, enabling efficient data scaling.
3. Each entry in a database is uniquely identified by its primary key, which must be distinct, non-null, and present in only one table. By making reference to the primary key, a foreign key connects two tables.
4. One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many are the three forms of relationships. Many-to-many links records across both tables, typically through a join table; one-to-many links one record in one table to multiples in another; and one-to-one links one record in each table.
5. An inner join only returns records that match in both tables, but a left join delivers all records from the left table plus matching ones from the right.
