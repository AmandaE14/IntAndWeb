1. For www.example.com, a query string with two values could look like www.example.com?name=Amy&age=22.
2. In order to guarantee that special characters are interpreted as literal characters rather than commands or delimiters in code, escaping a character requires adding a backslash before it.
3. The semantics of HTTP status codes are varied. The request was successful if the status code was 200. A 400 status code indicates that the request was poorly written because of improper syntax. The authentication needed for the 401 status code has either not been provided or has failed. A 403 status code indicates that access is prohibited. The requested resource was not found, as indicated by the 404 status code. Finally, when the server experiences an unforeseen circumstance, a 500 status code indicates an internal server fault.
4. Data must be validated to make sure it satisfies predetermined standards. It helps to avoid mistakes and security threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting by guaranteeing that only securely prepared data is processed.
5. Cookies and sessions are two ways to store user data. Cookies keep information on the client side, in the user's browser, whereas sessions store information on the server for every user session. In order to enable features like login persistence and tailored experiences, they help with tracking user behavior and preferences between requests.
