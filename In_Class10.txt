1. Built-in class that comes packaged with PHP to make it very easy for you to interact with databases is called PDOs.
2. We instantiate PDO objects with DSN strings, which represent the connection to our database.
3. A .env file is a file containing environment variables.
4. A gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project; we will need Git to ignore our .env file.
5. The PDO query method takes as an argument a SQL query and returns the results back as a PDO statement object, which we can then get data out of.
6. From the PDO statement object, we use the fetch method to return a single row of the SQL result set.
7. From the PDO statement object, we use the fetchAll method to return all rows of the SQL result set.
8. A prepared statement is a parameterized and reusable SQL query which forces the developer to write the SQL command and the user-provided data separately.
9. We call the prepare method with a SQL query with any dynamic parameters subbed in with names prefixed with colons.
10. A SQL injection hack is when a hacker tries to run malicious SQL code in a database.
