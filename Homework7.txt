1. In PHP, a class serves as a blueprint for building objects, specifying their attributes and functions. Object-Oriented Programming OOPÂ uses classes and objects to organize software. An object is an instance of a class.
2. In OOP, abstract classes serve as a foundation for subclass creation and offer default functionality; derived classes must implement specific methods.
3. PHP superglobals are predefined variables, such as $_SERVER, that are available across all scopes and supply data like the method and request URI.
4. In PHP, to utilize a class using namespaces, define the namespace in the class file first, then import it using the use keyword or instantiate it using the whole namespace path.
5. An application can be divided into three parts using the Model-View-Controller design pattern: the Model handles data logic, the View handles UI logic, and the Controller connects the Model and View and processes requests, improving code structure and maintainability.
